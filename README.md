- Confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification
- Automated prediction generation for each gameweek

### Performance Analytics

- Historical prediction tracking and accuracy metrics
- Visual performance dashboards with trend analysis
- Match-by-match result verification
- Statistical significance testing

### User Interface

- Responsive web application optimized for mobile and desktop
- Interactive data visualizations
- Real-time updates with automated result verification
- Clean, modern design with intuitive navigation

## Technical Architecture

### Machine Learning Pipeline

**Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier

- 300 decision trees with optimized hyperparameters
- Balanced class weights to address outcome distribution
- Cross-validation for model selection and tuning
- Feature importance analysis for model interpretability

**Training Data:**

- 2+ seasons of comprehensive La Liga match statistics
- 50+ engineered features per match
- Regular retraining cycles to capture current season dynamics

**Feature Engineering:**
The model incorporates multiple statistical dimensions:

- **Performance Metrics:** Points per game, goal differentials, shot accuracy
- **Form Analysis:** Rolling averages over 3, 5, and 10 match windows
- **Defensive Statistics:** Clean sheet rates, goals conceded patterns, defensive actions
- **Offensive Statistics:** Goals scored, expected goals (xG), shot conversion rates
- **Venue Effects:** Home/away performance splits and historical venue data
- **Head-to-Head:** Historical matchup statistics and recent encounters
- **League Position:** Performance against teams in different table positions

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**

- React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe component development
